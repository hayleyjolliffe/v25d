            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Brought on initially as a Digital Designer with leadership buy-in, I identified critical bottlenecks in DBS's internal operations and expanded my role into system design and design ops.</p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>The agency's workflows, file systems, and SOPs had not scaled beyond a 1â€“3 person team. As client volume and team size grew, inefficiencies multiplied.</p>
            <p>Outdated templates, inconsistent access, and fractured information flow caused frequent errors and delays.</p>

        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Initially tasked with updating templates, I realized the problem was more complex than that. I proposed and led a full systems overhaul, reframing the challenge as a design ops initiative.</p>
            <p>My work expanded to answer the high level question:</p>
            <p><i>"How might we scale an internal design system to support rapid company and client growth without adding workflow bottlenecks?"</i></p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>To answer this new question, my focus shifted.</p>
            <p>The goal was to eliminate redundancies, streamline access, and create scalable systems that empowered the entire team.</p>
            
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>I started by conducting audits of all workflows, tools, and templates, while tracking bottlenecks in live client work.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <p>With bottlenecks tracked, I was able to map redundancies, build updated file standards, and rebuild key systems in the tools most used by the team.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <p>I centralized instructions and SOPs into one documentation hub, testing frequently with non-technical teammates to ensure clarity and deploy without need for additional training.</p>
            <p>I owned the project end-to-end, from audit through rollout.</p>

        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>The overhaul drastically reduced errors, cut handoff delays, and enabled smoother onboarding for both clients and team members.</p>
            <p class="bottom">The new system improved daily efficiency and was praised by leadership as a foundation for continued scaling.</p>
