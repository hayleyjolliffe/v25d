            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>At DBS, I partnered with the Endometriosis Foundation of America on ENPOWR, a nationwide youth education initiative.</p>
            <p>Initially brought in as a brand designer, my role expanded to focus on systems design, where I had full ownership of creating scalable brand and campaign frameworks.</p>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>ENPOWR's mission was to deliver comprehensive menstrual health education and reduce the average 10-year delay to endometriosis diagnosis.</p>
            <p>The challenge was twofold:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Design educational materials that resonate with high school students, while operating within the constraints of a government-affiliated nonprofit.</li>
                <li>Equip non-technical stakeholders with the tools to independently create campaigns and collateral without relying on designers.</li>
            </ol>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>With the team tackling the project's identity, I had a different question to answer:</p>
            <p><i>“How might we design a flexible system that educates and empowers high school students while being simple enough for non-technical stakeholders to run independently?”</i></p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>To answer both high level questions, I developed a dual-layered design system that incorporated the identity the team developed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A flexible, youth-appropriate visual identity tailored to resonate with a high school audience.</li>
                <li>A practical toolkit of ready-to-use templates and components, built around tools stakeholders already knew (incl. Canva and Google Workspace), drastically reducing the technical barrier to execution.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>I led with researching comparable government and nonprofit education initiatives to analyze how they balanced approachability with institutional credibility.</p>
            <p>When the stakeholders' technical gap was identified, I reframed the design solution around accessibility of use, not just visual consistency.</p>
            <p>As the team developed the identity within our workflows, I rebuilt critical touchpoints in the same tools EndoFound used, eventually leading creation of the systems that could be stress-tested directly with the stakeholders.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>While metrics were not shared due to NDA, stakeholders reported significant improvements in workflow efficiency.</p>
            <p class="bottom">By removing barriers around collateral creation, the system freed their time and focus for the initiative's core mission: educating students and fostering self-advocacy.</p>
