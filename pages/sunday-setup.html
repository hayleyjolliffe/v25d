            <h2>Sunday Setup</h2>
            <p>Founder-led initiative to transform plaintext emails into a recognizable brand sending emails readers enjoy opening.</p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>I was engaged by Sunday Setup, a productivity-focused newsletter for knowledge workers, to establish the brand identity and design core email templates.</p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Sunday Setup's strong content wasn't matched by presentation: no brand identity, no templates, and only plaintext emails.</p>
            <p>Engagement lagged, with readers dropping off before long-term retention. Without a clear identity, the newsletter struggled to grow or attract sponsorships.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>They had the content, but lacked critical elements needed to monetize.</p>
            <p>The challenge was to fill in these gaps and put Sunday Setup on a path to achieving brand recognition beyond being "the guys that send the plaintext emails".</p>
            <p><i>How might we transform a plaintext newsletter into a recognizable brand and scalable email system that drives engagement and growth?</i></p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>To answer this question, we made the decision to expand scope to include email templates that covered their core email structures.</p>
            <p>With content already nailed down, the goal was to ensure Sunday Setup had a recognizable identity and scalable design infrastructure.</p>
            <p>We needed to encourage and support growth without bogging down the lean, established systems they already had in place.</p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>I started by using Sunday Setup's existing research to identify exact practices we could leverage from competitors in our own brand expression and email design.</p>
            <p>With best practices identified, I was able to pair a scalable component library with the full brand identity, along with one cohesive usage guide for speed and ease-of-use.</p>

            <p>Reusable email templates and components covered the newsletter's core flows and content types, prioritizing readability and brand consistency, while leaving the door open to future structures and flows.</p>

            <p>Documenting all component usage ensures future content could be produced with minimal design support or changes to their existing workflows.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>The rollout established a recognizable visual identity and modular system that scaled with Sunday Setup's growth.</p>
