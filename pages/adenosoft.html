            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>As the founder and lead designer, I set out to establish a scalable brand identity and design system to support Adenosoft's digital products and future growth.</p>
            <p>This was an opportunity to approach the work as both a product designer and system builder, defining standards that could scale with new products, features, and teams.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Without a system in place, future development would risk inconsistent design decisions, fragmented user experiences, and slower delivery cycles.</p>
            <p>For an emerging company, building scalability into the foundation was critical.</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The challenge was to create a cohesive design system that could unify Adenosoft’s brand expression with its digital product interfaces.</p>
            <p>The high level question to focus on was:</p>
            <p><i>"How might we align brand and product design into a single system that strengthens usability and fosters consistency across user journeys?"</i></p>
        
        </r-cell>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>To answer this question, I landed on developing a modular design system rooted in accessibility, consistency, and scalability.</p>
            <p>The goal was to create a framework flexible enough to support both brand touchpoints (website, marketing) and future product interfaces while reducing long-term design and development overhead.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>I started by conducting audits of comparable SaaS companies to identify best practices for the system scalability I anticipated would be faced in the future.</p>

        <r-cell span=1+3 span-s=row>

            <p>Identifying critical components allowed me to define the core brand language that could be extended further into UI tokens and reusable components as our flagship product took shape.</p>

            <p>Anticipating future team members, establishing the system in Figma with accompanying was critical&mdash;setting the foundation early for future collaboration.</p>

            <p>To stress-test the system, I began prototyping system application across key contexts: website, interfaces, and internal materials.</p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>The result was a flexible design system that unified Adenosoft’s brand and product identity. This work established a foundation for consistent user experiences, streamlined future product design, and reduced redundancy by enabling rapid component reuse.</p>
            <p class="bottom">Beyond immediate application, the system positioned Adenosoft to scale its product line without design debt.</p>
