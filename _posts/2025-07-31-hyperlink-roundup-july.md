excerpt: Regaining connection with creators I value.
---
Admittedly, my screen time has gotten out of hand recently. I've fallen victim to doomscrolling sessions many times, and I've started losing touch with the media I enjoy consuming. Heading into August, I want to be more intentional with what I consume, and start regaining connection with the creators I value.

Despite consuming an embarrassing amount of brainrot and mindless content, I want to highlight a few things of interest I stumbled upon:
## [Forever ✱ Notes](https://myforevernotes.com)
I am a huge sucker for learning new productivity systems. I came across Forever ✱ Notes on YouTube, and thought it looked very interesting. I've tried many apps and systems, sticking with [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com) over the years, and eventually developing my own digital framework. It's interesting to see how others interpret the same inputs to create their systems.

## [2 weird things that cured my procrastination., Ann the Philosopher](https://youtu.be/FC4HGPLf6VY?si=7teYXPsnLmbx4QfS)
I've been enjoying "short-form" videos lately (3-8 min.) as well as long-form. While these "weird things" aren't new to me, finding new, smaller creators has been extremely refreshing. The dead internet theory crosses my mind daily, and it's nice to find blatantly human creators, for lack of a better term. I'll definitely keep an eye out for more of Ann's videos.

## [Moving into my new NYC apartment, jedcal](https://youtu.be/GDG3BGrPFSU?si=W--CcwNOHiROFBUl)
Another shorter, refreshing video. I enjoy seeing moving/apartment tour videos that aren't overproduced, with creators flexing trends and expensive furniture that's unrealistic for most. As I'm currently considering moving to a new city, I've enjoyed finding studio setups as I gather inspiration for what my next space might look like.
