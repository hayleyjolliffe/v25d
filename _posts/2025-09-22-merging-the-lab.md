excerpt: I neglected to identify a critical piece of information.
---

A few weeks back, I [introduced the R&D lab](/introducing-the-rd-lab). I built it with the intention of doing the opposite of what is typically done on a project like this. I wanted to *underengineer* and keep the system as lean as possible. I neglected to identify a critical piece of information: the bulk of my research eventually forms finished notes on my main site. As I've been sifting through my working notes to begin publishing and build out the site's functionality, I've started to recognize the number of redundancies in keeping the sites separate.

As I worked through updating my portfolio for Q4 into 2026, I realized to underengineer this system was to merge the two into a more comprehensive site, and cull my working notes ruthlessly.

I've made a few executive decisions to keep the system lean. Updates will be weekly instead of on-the-fly; this will give me the chance to flesh out notes in more detail before they're publish, allowing for earlier control over tags, categories, and linking.

I won't rush the navigation system, either. As much as I'd love to get a simple working solution going, that won't help me to keep things lean and underengineered. That functionality will get added to the queue of things I'd like to work on, and I'll see what develops naturally inside my Obsidian vault before I commit to building anything out.

These decisions will also allow me to see how the updated site's rollout goes. I have a few things in the works, but I want to see how the site lives and breathes before I introduce any major features.
