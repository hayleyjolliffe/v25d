excerpt: What begins as raw thinking in Obsidian can become structured documentation...
---
Recently, I embarked on a new project. Largely inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org), [Caleb Porzio](https://calebporzio.com), and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://nesslabs.com), I wanted to find a way to use my interests and design/stylistic preferences to design a new, scalable workflow for self-directed research. I wanted a system that could handle learning, experimentation, and documentation without becoming overengineered or collapsing under its own weight. What emerged is a purposefully *underengineered*, lightweight R&D lab environment—part publishing tool, part knowledge infrastructure—built entirely for working, playing, and learning in public.

At its core, the site connects two environments I already rely on and value deeply: Obsidian for research and file storage, and Jekyll for publishing. The pairing allows notes, experiments, and insights to move from private exploration to public visibility with minimal friction. What begins as raw thinking in Obsidian can become structured documentation on the website, preserving context while lower the the cost of sharing.

The design goal wasn't aesthetic-based, but rather scalability-first. I approached this as I would any system design problem: what workflows encourage, what structures scale as research expands, and what automation keeps the system from becoming brittle and overengineered. That meant building processes for linking knowledge, surfacing patterns, and generating insights automatically, rather than manually curating everything.

For now, the lab is primarily a personal tool, a public extension of my own learning environment. I'm carefully sifting through entries manually as I determine what is and isn't "ready" to become public-facing, but the long-term intent is to create a foundation for more formal research. By treating the site as a transparent workspace, I'm practicing living out one of my key values, [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zCMhncA1iSE74MKKYQS5PBZ). Eventually, the aim is to secure crowdfunded research grants, much like [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org) and other independent researchers.

This isn't a finished product; it's a living system. The lab will evolve as my methods evolve, but the underlying principle will remain the same: research should be visible, iterative, and scalable.
