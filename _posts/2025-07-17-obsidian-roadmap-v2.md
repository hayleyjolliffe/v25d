Obsidian Roadmap has quietly been updated. It's the same personal roadmap vault made cleaner, faster, and more frictionless. v2.0.0 strips what got in the way in favour of leaner workflows and simpler navigation. Sections are more clearly organized and defined.

Development of v2.0.0 was driven by real usage, both my own and others'. It's still not flashy, just a more efficient way to track goals, reflect across time, and build momentum within Obsidian.

You can download the updated Vault template [here](https://github.com/hayleyjolliffe/obsidian-roadmap). As always, open-source forever.
