I was recently introduced to the concept of the Output-Native Mindset through Joan Westenberg's video, "The Output-Native Mindset That Changes Everything"[^1]. In it, Westenberg describes a case for becoming "output-native", embracing the instinct to create by default as opposed to promoting by default. By the end of the nine minute video, I came to the realization that this information was not new to me, it just finally gave a name to the concept I'd been exploring. With this name, I was able to start making connections I hadn't noticed previously. It led me to begin addressing the question: **Is it difficult to become output-native?**

To begin, it's essential to determine your current default mode of learning: passive or active? An easy way to check this is to utilize a "quiz and recall" technique. In his book "How to Become a Straight-A Student"[^2], Cal Newport describes the learning method as the most effective way to actively learn. While this may not feel like the case for some learners, it's a sentiment that several experts share. This exact sentiment led me to Parker Settecase's exploration of new subject mastery[^3].

Settecase describes his appreciation for the method, as he finds it to be "brutally honest" and effective for highlighting knowledge gaps. The method is simple: review the concept, then try to explain it, unaided and in your own terms. As Charlotte Fraza[^4] puts it, "If you cannot reproduce something, whether it's an argument, formula, or concept, you haven't fully learned it". This led me to another realization. Newport, Settecase, and Fraza all utilize this method in an academic contextâ€”how might it translate to self-led learning environments?

Settecase's second method for subject mastery proved to be my answer. The method, "outline your essays" translates brilliantly to my digital-native, self-led research: blogging. Admittedly, I've come to resent the term as of late, and describe my "blog entries" as "lab notes". Regardless of terminology, Fraza's recommendations echo Settecase's. Settecase and Fraza both recommend synthesizing notes in a dedicated location. For Settecase, his manuscript commonplace book; for Fraza, her second brain system. Personally, I employ an analog journaling method I would describe as a combination of the traditional commonplace book[^5] and Bullet Journaling[^6], plus some tweaks to satisfy personal preferences. When I'm ready to bring everything into the digital world, my Obsidian workspace suffices.

Since I'm not constrained by syllabi or deadlines as in the cases of Newport, Settecase, and Fraza, I needed to find an effective cadence for utilizing this method. This brought me back to the work of Anne-Laure Le Cunff. In her book, Tiny Experiments[^7], Le Cunff presents her PACT method as an alternative to traditional habit-tracking. She goes on to describe the first pact she ever made with herself: writing a blog post every day for a month. Fraza and Settecase both recommend making active reflection a daily habit. When the two are put together, I've found my cadence and pact:

**I will publish one essay/lab note every day in September.**

In pursuing this pact, I should find an answer to my question, **is it difficult to become output-native?** The barrier to entry is lower than embarking on an ambitious habit-tracked goal, I am not bound by ineffective SMART goals, I will have the opportunity to learn about things of interest, and thirty days should be sufficient to determine to some degree whether or not I have become, or am in the process of becoming, output-native.
