My reading habits have taken a sharp nosedive off a cliff. I've DNF'ed the bulk of my reads as of late, and it's created feelings of guilt to the point of just. Not reading. I want that to change.

The reality is, my partner and I have different interests than our friends, especially when it comes to reading topics. With many of these reads coming as recs from friends, it's no wonder I've DNF'ed so many.

I struggle a lot with reading style, especially with fiction, so I need to find books that work for me. That's why I wiped my [Literal account](https://literal.club/hayleyjolliffe) for a fresh start. My lists were filled with books that weren't for me, and reading started to feel performative. It shouldn't feel like that. My lists should be for me, and I should enjoy what I read.

That said, I'll continue to take recommendations. I'll just take them with a grain of salt and not beat myself up so much if they don't work out.
