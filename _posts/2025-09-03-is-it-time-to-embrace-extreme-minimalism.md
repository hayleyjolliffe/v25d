excerpt: How little of what's typically deemed "essential" is actually essential to me?
---
Packing for a move is always a test of priorities. What feels completely "essential" in one space suddenly starts to look more negotiable as every item needs to be packed, moved, and unpacked.

I've been a minimalist for a decade, but planning out the next phase of my life has resurfaced ideas I was first introduced to in my early days of minimalism in high school. I had discovered The Minimalists' podcast[^1], and was intrigued by Ryan Nicodemus' "Packing Party"[^2]—an experiment where Ryan, being introduced to minimalism, packed up all his belongings as if he was moving. For the next 21 days, Ryan only unpacked what he needed as he needed it. When the 21 days was up, Ryan realized how little of his belongings had been unpacked, and he donated or sold everything left in the boxes. It was an extreme introduction to minimalism, but it provided a clear question: **What of our belongings is truly essential?**

Ten years later, the question feels sharper than ever. Minimalism isn't new to me anymore. It's long-since become my way of life, but the planning stages of the move has exposed something different: how little of what's typically deemed "essential" is actually essential to me.

To explore this further, I set a challenge for myself: make the move as affordable and easy as possible by only taking a carry-on and backpack with me—no paying for baggage. Everything I own that matters should fit in those two bags, nothing more. The idea of stepping off the plane with my partner waiting, carrying only what I need to begin the next chapter of my life, felt like the truest possible expression of minimalism I could embody.

This realization raised a larger questions, not just about decluttering, but about extremes. **What does is mean to embrace minimalism not as a phase or experiment, but as a radical reduction, a discipline, or even a ritual?**

Ryan Nicodemus' Packing Party was a temporary solution that he opted to make permanent. He could have returned everything to where it came from after those three weeks. For Tokimaru Tanaka[^3], that reduction was intentionally permanent from the start. He lives with about 150 items. In a recent video[^4], he details his most-used items, which amount to only 66 of his 150 possessions. Tanaka reframes Ryan's packing party question: instead of "what do you use?", he asks "what will you commit to carrying, every day, for life?"

The shift from experiment to identity is what makes extreme minimalism both fascinating and uncomfortable. When the reduction is permanent, the practice changes you. You begin to see life through the lens of choice, not accumulation.

But despite current trends, minimalism doesn't just belong to contemporary experiments documented online. The Stoics practiced their own form of radical reduction. Seneca[^5] suggested "practicing poverty" for days at a time—eating the cheapest food, wearing the roughest clothes—not as punishment, but as preparation. If you can endure less, you realize how little you actually need, and the fear of loss loosens its hold. Marcus Aurelius frames similar sentiments throughout his Meditations[^6] as he contemplates life. Everyone meets the same end: death. Where Tanaka's possessions are counted, the Stoics counted feelings and desires. Both approaches converge on the same insight: sufficiency isn't about owning more, but wanting less.

In *chanoyu*[^7], the Japanese tea ceremony, minimalism takes on a different form. The ritual pares everything back to the essentials: a tea bowl, a whisk, deliberate gestures. The focus isn't on scarcity, but rather respect and precision. Within strict constraints, the act of making tea becomes elevated, even profound. In this instance, minimalism becomes ritual. By reducing choice and ornament, chanoyu sharpens attention until every detail carries meaning.

That same spirit carries into unexpected corners of the present. Samurai Matcha[^8] embodies a form of ritual minimalism, documenting his life and process on his YouTube channel. His videos share simple routines, uncluttered setups, and a deliberate pace that challenges the maximalism of typical online content. In an approach that appears to blend Nicodemus' packing party with Tanaka's extreme minimalism, Samurai Matcha's unique lifestyle allows him to experiment with extreme minimalism, which he often documents through his minimalism challenges[^9]. As with chanoyu, the point isn't emptiness, but rather focus.

In both cases, minimalism is less about what's removed and more about what becomes visible when the excess is no longer there.

This brings me back to planning my move. Everything I've reflected on points to the same truth: we don't need as much as we think we do. Even at it's extreme, minimalism continues to be about clarity, not deprivation. Embracing the constraints of my baggage challenge is simply my way of exploring that clarity further. If I can step off the plane with everything important in hand, ready to start the next chapter with my partner, then the experiment will have done its work.

What remains will be enough.
