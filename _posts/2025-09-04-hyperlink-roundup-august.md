excerpt: I did not anticipate getting back into drawing or PewDiePie videos in 2025.
---
Last month, I made a note to spend more of my online time regaining connection with the people and things that are most important to me[^1]. This is exactly what I did. It doesn't feel right to bundle things like calling my grandparents, FaceTiming my boyfriend, or having a games night with friends over Discord fall into the "online time = bad" label simply because my proverbial village is scattered across the globe and we rely on the internet to maintain connection, so I changed how I looked at it. My main issue with my time spent online was with dead time—time spent idling in apps, doomscrolling, wandering aimlessly without a clear intention.

When I made that shift, I noticed something far more dramatic than I anticipated. Not only did I enjoy more intentional experiences with loved ones, creators I value, workouts, and learning—I reconnected with hobbies and interests I didn't anticipate. Not only did I finally cross a few movies off my watchlist and enjoy time with family, my boyfriend, and our friends, but I picked up drawing again after having not drawn in over five years. Where I didn't previously "have time or energy" for anything, I was beginning to find time. I was beginning to make time. And with that came the energy.

Moving forward, I think it best to shift the naming convention from "MONTH internet consumption" to simply "MONTH consumption". This month was not about simply "consuming content" in the slightest, but I do want to provide a bit of a highlight reel of things I enjoyed these past few weeks:

- F1[^2]
- Lelouch's blog[^3]
- Dominic Hart, This book changed my life.[^4]
- Morgan Olson/momomuscle[^5]
- PewDiePie, Giving you guys a chance....[^6]

Let the record show I did not anticipate getting back into drawing *or* PewDiePie videos in 2025. The internet is wild. Here's to another month of intentional consumption.
