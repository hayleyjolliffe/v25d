excerpt: Funding is being redirected, with a lot of it being shifted from books.

While running errands today I saw a local library branch had recently reopened after almost two years of renovations. I decided to pop in and explore, and I while I'll admit I haven't frequented the public library in longer than I'd like to admit, I was shocked by the sheer *lack* of books I encountered.

A sign on the shelf said there would be a grand reopening party in a few weeks, and I overheard a librarian telling a patron that they were waiting on more of their books to come back from other branches, but that many books were going to be taken out of circulation. Funding is being redirected, with a lot of it being shifted from books to digital programming. What was once an old library overflowing with books and character now looks like a massive hospital waiting room with small bookshelves pushed to the side.

Call me cynical and old, but the digital programming I saw? Sixteen brand new workstations, all of them being used by screaming children playing Roblox, not a single book in sight.

Is this the future of libraries?
