excerpt: Detailed planning in advance can serve extremely well... but it's not always effective.
---
The biggest factor in my struggle with change is my ability to plan. Detailed planning in advance can serve extremely well when managing multiple areas, deadlines, and/or people, like in work and school settings, but it's not always effective when managing smaller, everyday tasks.

With this in mind, this experiment will operate on the following principles:

1. Default to action
2. Rescue yourself

**Default to action** means using planning strategically. What's the minimum amount of time/planning/resources required to execute? When executed correctly, planning and thinking should be commensurate with the task at hand. For example, managing a client project should utilize more thinking and planning than getting dressed in the morning.

**Rescue yourself** means putting in the work. Nobody is coming to save me or do the work for me. I can ask for help where needed, but I cannot rely on anyone to manage myself or do the hard work for me. This is the resiliency I want to increase.

A large component of this experiment will be learning to effectively determine the amount of thinking and planning required to execute. With this in mind, I'll set a few parameters for loose expectations, and let myself learn as I go.

1. Key areas will be: Mindset, body, learning, and vocation.
2. This is **not** a "backlog-tackling sprint"
3. Minimize inputs, maximize outputs

Additionally, updates will be on Mondays. Let's see what can happen in 30 days.
